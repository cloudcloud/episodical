        "overview": "Today is the first day of the rest of Earl Hickey's life. After coming into a $100,000 scratch-off lottery ticket and losing it just as fast upon being hit by a car, Earl has an epiphany in the hospital--to make up for all the terrible things he's done in the past. With his brother Randy and a motel maid named Catalina, Earl writes up a list of every misdeed he was a part of. Earl sets out to do just that, starting with #64--Kenny James, a boy he picked on in elementary school.\r\n\r\nRecap\r\n\r\nWhen we meet Earl Hickey, he describes himself as \"that guy you see going into the convenience store when you stop off in that little town on the way to Grandma's house--sorta shifty looking fellow who buys a pack of smokes, a couple lotto scratchers and a tallboy at 10 in the morning.\" He's a petty thief who proceeds to steal some CDs and a flag from a van parked outside of the aforementioned convenience store.\r\n\r\nEarl's narration introduces us to Joy, his unfaithful wife of, presumably, six years. He also introduces his two children (neither of which he fathered), Dodge and Earl Jr, and his brother Randy. The narration montage also introduces Darnell, an employee at Ernie's Crab Shack and also the father of Earl Jr.\r\n\r\nThis all brings us to three weeks ago. Earl gets his due in the form of a $100,000 scratch off ticket... only to promptly lose it when he runs into traffic and gets hit by a car. He wakes up in a hospital with an injured leg and neck, a morphine drip, and divorce papers from Joy. While flipping channels on the television, Earl stops on Carson Daly's late night talk show. Carson recites his philosophy on karma and it inspires an epiphany in Earl. After he's released, he and Randy get set up in a motel room, where Randy quickly makes nice with the maid, Catalina. Earl decides that he will write out a list of all of the bad things he's done and sets out to right his wrongs. He starts with #136, being a litterbug. Right after throwing away garbage in the motel parking",

Earl adds a new quest to his list and that is getting Randy a touchdown in High school football. The story behind it is that Earl bet money that Randy's team would lose while he was playing football. Randy helped out by playing horribly, but the last play of the game, down by one touchdown, Randy finds he has the ball and starts running to the end zone. He realizes he could actually score a touchdown but chooses to fumble the ball and lose the game. Earl feels so bad about doing that he gets Randy back in to High school with the worst football team in the area.\r\nMeanwhile Earl's ex-wife Joy has Earl's car towed, along with his money hidden under the driver's seat. When Earl and Randy go to question Joy, Randy accidentally reveals where the money is hidden. The chase is on! Earl gets to the car lot first but the people working there wont let him near the car until he pays the $3,000 in parking violations on it. Joy soon shows up and gets the same answer. So now Earl has to come up with $3,000 to get his car and lottery money back. He knows there is no way to get that much money so he has to break in and steal the car. His plan comes to him when Randy is studying up on History. The Trojan Horse, but instead a car with someone hiding in the trunk.\r\nJoy is still trying to get the money, too. She pawns a bunch of things and gets closer to the $3,000. Earl gets his recently redeemed friend Kenny to help. Kenny's friend has a car they can use to get towed. After Earl fails to fit in the tiny trunk, Kenny offers to do it for him. This leaves Earl and Catalina free to go to Randy's Football game. He doesn't score a touchdown until the final play of the game, in the huddle of the team, Randy says to give the ball to him. Th",

        "overview": "Earl tries to cross of number four off his list “Blew dad’s chance to be elected mayor”. Four years earlier, Carl Hickey ran for mayor to redirect a proposed airplane traffic route over his house and away from the wealthy part of town. Earl unfortunately ruins any chances of his father winning when caught in on tape assaulting a police officer.  Earl must now help his father get elected and mend his relationship with his father.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecap:\r\n\r\nIt begins with hearing Earl talking to himself that he is not too eager to Cross Number 86 off his list, which is: 'Stealing a Car from a 'One-legged Girl' Well but he overcomes his fear and goes to her house. He tries to explain, she curses at him and then her no-legged, but fitted with prosthetic legs, boyfriend runs after him, and as we know the Hickey Boys aren't that fast, so he catches up with him and beats him with a sign which he takes as a hint from \"Karma\" that he should be somewhere else that day. He thinks about that while getting beaten with a sign which says \"Marty Park for Mayor\". Which brings him to Number 4 on his list: \"Blew Dad's Chance to get elected Mayor.\" For this you have to know that Earls father always complained about things and never did anything about it. But when they put the airplane route right above his neighborhood he decided to run for Mayor. In the course of that you see Earl and his brother always getting into trouble, first as children and then as young adults and their father always bailing them out of jail. But then he stopped bailing Earl out. But his opponent used the bad sons, more so Earl than Randy against him and thereby causing him to lose the election. They didn't talk since then. Well, so much for the past. Now, trying to make things right, Earl signs him up to run for Mayor again. And even finds new voters to register. But when, due to Randy's fault, the Voter Registrations are flying out of the Car and due to a misunderstanding with the Police while trying to pick up the",

        "overview": "As the holiday season comes under way a few secrets are exposed when Earl attempts to cross number seventy-four off of his list: \"always ruined Joy's Christmas.\" Earl, Randy, and Catalina enter a radio contest to win a brand new car for Joy to make up for all of the thoughtless Christmas presents Earl gave her while they were married. While Randy and Catalina vie over the car, Earl finds out that Joy's parents believe that he's still their son-in-law and that he's just returned from the war in Iraq. Joy is afraid to tell her father, an alleged racist, that she is now married to Darnell, so Earl plays the part, afraid of ruining another one of her Christmases.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecap:\r\n\r\nOf course this episode is again about doing things right, but with a little difference: This time there are other people too who, well didn't do all bad things BUT they all have secrets.\r\nThis episode begins with a contest. The contest consists of the following. You have to keep at least one hand on the Car which you can win at all times. (I think it's a Dodge Neon.. but I am not sure), Why does Earl want to win the contest when he got a perfectly fine '73 Al Camino with nice '77 Door and a 1987 Camero Transmission.? Of course! It's for the List! Number 74: 'Always ruined Joys Christmas'. You see a few examples. 2002: He gives her something that looks like empty shell casings and gets asked: What shall I use them for? And he says: Whatever you like.\r\n2003: She gets flavored condoms\r\n2004: She gets Keys and says: \"Wait, these are my keys?\" and he says: \"Yes, I found them\" (Very funny moment in this episode).\r\nWell, we are back at the contest. His brothers asks: \"What does she need a new car for, she already has one\" After that you see a extremely funny scene (and a little sad) where she and Darnell get out of the car .. and you see the two children in the back in the middle of the rain. And that kinda makes the point for earl. Back at the contest. Just when it began Earl shakes Randy's hand, and a",

Earl, Randy and Catalina travel to the camp to make amends for the barn burning by building a pen for the camp’s ostrich.  Earl learns the real reason behind the barn burning incident and decides that every incident on his list after the fire should be shared by Randy.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecap:\r\n\r\nThe episode begins as we find Randy playing the crane game in the Crab Shack. There is a live rat inside, and Randy wins it. Unfortunately, he gets bitten as it was having it's way with Grover when Randy so rudely pulled it out. Joy complains to Darnell about the kids, saying they are even too bad to visit the \"Right Choice Ranch\", a place where Earl and Randy went as kids. Darnell says he is busy, but Joy reminds him that he's only delivering crabs, not doing a transplantectomy.\r\n\r\nEarl doesn't want to deal with the kids and tries to avoid Joy, but the Ranch is on his list - he burned a barn down throwing away a cigarette. He decides to go, and tries to keep it a secret because Randy is afraid of birds. When asked where they are going, Earl only offers that \"they do not have funnel cakes.\" Upon arrival, Randy cunningly tries to avoid the birds at the Ranch (but ends up playing dead and begs two children to call the cops) while Earl volunteers to help build an ostrich pen.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing how much the kids enjoyed seeing his good example (and Catalina), Earl realizes that if he hadn't burned down the barn, Randy would probably have a better life. Earl decides to add Randy to the list, but Randy isn't happy about that. After some arguing, a mishap lands a nail through Earl's hand. We remember Randy's fear of blood, and he admits that it was his fault the barn burned down. Turns out he dropped an oil lamp by the still lit cigarette after a bird scared him.\r\n\r\nEarl realizes that Randy is responsible for everything -",

And, it seems when you find yourself with a lot of money you go to Jasper's. What is Jasper's you may well ask? \"Jasper\"s is kind of like the mall, only it's in a storage unit and everything there was stolen from the mall.\" The gang spends the thousand dollars they had on many things that day and according to Earl, they were living like kings. But back to today, when faced with the reality of having to give up his helmet bought that day long ago, Randy asks Earl why he can't just give the guy back his wallet with a thousand dollars of his lottery money stuffed in it.
